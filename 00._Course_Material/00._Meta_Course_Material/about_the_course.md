# About this Course: **Full Stack Node.js**

Reflect on the course's title. Besides Node.js it is:

- UX is important. Always think before you code. We have a code first approach in class because we are constrained by time. This is not ideal.

- Understanding the relationship between backend and frontend is crucial.

## Course Components

### Lectures

This course is based on live coding. If you run into problems then ask me for more time or help. 

If I evaluate that the lecture must proceed then please drop it and debug at a later time.

I don't want you to lose out on important new information.

Here are some useful tips regarding [debugging](/00._Course_Material/00._Meta_Course_Material/debugging_tips.md) in general.

### Homework

- Exercises that you must hand-in. We will try to use Github Classrooms this semester. Let me know if anyone of you prefer to submit through Teams.

### Mandatories

Prerequisite to go to the exam.

1. **Mandatory I**: Create a documentation website. Start documenting now!

2. **Mandatory II**: Create an auth system.

### Exam Project

Solo or in groups. This is a large full-stack project that is different from the other projects. The requirements are basic so consider something you really want to build and put the hours into. A solid project is a good start for the exam.

- Must include the auth from mandatory II. 

It is a requirement that your code follows clean code practices. Consider setting up a [linter](/00._Course_Material/00._Meta_Course_Material/linters_overview.md) early in the course so that you can get accustomed to working with them.

## Additional Notes

### Communication

-  I really hope that people will be active on Teams. For all communication use the class channel in Teams for transparency. @ me so I can see if you have typed a question there. 

Besides deeply personal matters all communication should be in the Teams channel. This create transparency and gives everyone the ability to see the discussion and my answers. 

### Co-pilot Usage

Co-pilot is an excellent tool and I recommend that you use it in your future endeavours but for this course I highly recommend that you refrain from using it. Arguments:

- Co-pilot takes focus away from what is being explained in class.

- Rather than learning to choose, you should question and understand. 

- You should know how to write the syntax.

- During the exam you will be live coding and co-pilot is not an option. 

- It is extremely obvious when you bring code solved by AI to the exam. Don't do that.
