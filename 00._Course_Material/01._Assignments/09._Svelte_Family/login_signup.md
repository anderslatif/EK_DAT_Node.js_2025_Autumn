# Login / Signup

Use plain HTML to create a dummy login / signup form. 

From best to worst (all are acceptable):

1. A fancy single card that flips between login and signup. 

2. Two HTML pages. 

3. A single HTML page that shows both at once. 

Feel free to let yourselves be inspired by solutions online. 

There is no hand-in or deadline for this assignment. 

It will be part of Mandatory II so creating a nice visually appealing login / signup form will help ease your workload in the future. 

You can always put the HTML into a Svelte component later on, so focus on making it in HTML for now.
