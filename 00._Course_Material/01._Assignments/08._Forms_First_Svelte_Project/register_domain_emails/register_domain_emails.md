# [Optional] Register domains and emails

Note that this it is outside of the learning goals to actually send out emails. It is allowed to fake it with `nodemailer` or the `resend` boarding mail. 

I include it here because it feels better to be able to send out real emails programatically. 

Solving this task will be seen as a bonus in the exam project but only if has been done additionally to a lot of features that fall under the learning goals.

Step 1 is to get your voucher code from Teams.
